Changelog:
eduActiv8 - 4.81.008:
    - the menu has been replaced with a full screen activity selection screen
        - this allows to display all activity icons without scrolling
        - more space for activities since the menu does not take up any screen space while in activity mode
        - the icons on new menu screen now display progress for each challenge activity
        - the category and activity icons have been redesigned and scaled up
    - theme editing screen added to customize UI and menu colours
    - a number of new activities added - covering elapsed time as well as negative numbers and equivalent fractions
    - a lot of cosmetic fixes across the application

eduActiv8 - 3.80.411:
    - 20 new activities covering fractions, decimals, percentages and ratios - translations required for most languages.
    - 4 new activities covering linear symmetry
    - menu has been slightly redesigned - the activity icons now also have an accompanying icon indicating whether the activity is a simulation/demonstration of a concept or if it is a task that needs solving, or something else.
    - from this version the game will check for updates and will let users know if a new one has been released - update will still have to be downloaded manually - can be disabled from the settings in the login screen. This option may need to be hidden before packaging for any distros - will sort it out with next release.
